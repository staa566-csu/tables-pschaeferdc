<p>This table is based on a work project a few years back when we attempted to determine whether there were parts of the US energy infrastructure that contributed a ‘dispoportionate’ amount to the overall capacity. We wanted to know if there were a ‘relatively small’ number of production facilities that produced a ‘relatively large’ percentage of different outputs. That project involved Excel, which meant the tables were dreadful, so we ended up putting the results on a map instead. This is an attempt to produce a table that gives the same information.</p>
<p>The data source is a .csv downloaded from the US Energy Information Agency website: https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/ngqs/#?report=RP9&amp;year1=2017&amp;year2=2017&amp;company=Name The data is based on 2017 reporting and was released in 2019.</p>
