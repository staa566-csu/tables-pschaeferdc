## Data import and cleaning
```{r message = FALSE}
gas <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\pscha\\Documents\\_School\\2022_Fall_Classes\\STAA_566_DataViz\\natgas.csv")
gas <- gas[complete.cases(gas[ , 8]),] # get rid on NAs in Capacity
cap <- sum(gas$Capacity)
rank <- c(1:nrow(gas))
gas <- gas %>%
  mutate(percent=Capacity/cap) #calculate percentage of total
gas <- gas[order(-gas$percent),]
gas <- gas %>%
  mutate(cum_per=cumsum(percent),rank = rank)%>%# calculate cumulative percentage

## Make the table
```{r}
gas_table2 <- gas %>%
  select(rank,Name, Owner, Capacity,percentile) %>%
  reactable(
    defaultColDef = colDef(align = 'center'),
    columns = list(
      rank = colDef(name = "Rank", align = 'right'),
      Name = colDef(name = "Name", align = 'left'),
      Owner = colDef(name = "Owner", align = 'left'),
      Capacity = colDef(name = "Capacity (M cu. ft. per day)", align = 'right'),
      percentile = colDef(name = 'Percentile'), align = 'right'),
    style = list(fontSize = "1rem"))
gas_table2
```

This table is based on a work project a few years back when we attempted to determine whether there were parts of the US energy infrastructure that contributed a 'dispoportionate' amount to the overall capacity. We wanted to know if there were a 'relatively small' number of production facilities that produced a 'relatively large' percentage of different outputs. That project involved Excel, which meant the tables were dreadful, so we ended up putting the results on a map instead. This is an attempt to produce a table that gives the same information.

I limited the coulmns to the ones that we would have used for the project: the name, owner, capacity, and the percentile that the plant fell in. 

The data source is a .csv downloaded from the US Energy Information Agency website: https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/ngqs/#?report=RP9&year1=2017&year2=2017&company=Name 
The data is based on 2017 reporting and was released in 2019.
